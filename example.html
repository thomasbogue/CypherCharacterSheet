      <span class="ability">Natural Magic (1 Intellect Point, Action)</span>
      <p>In any plane, you can summon "small magics". somtimes called cantrips.  You can light candles, draw a cupful of water from the air, life and move small objects, cleanse objects, color objects, and more.  Effects generally last no longer than the next sunrise/sunset.  In the Fae realm, you can do more.  For example, you can create small objects (maximum level 1), pulling them from thin air;  intensify or calm local weather; and cause a plant to grow, blossom, or wither.  You can not create a plant from nothing (must have at least a seed to start with) and you can not create a living creature.  You can not use Magic in the Blood to harm any creature directly or to destroy an object directly.</p>
      <span class="ability">Cruelty (enabler)</span>
      <p>When you use force, you can choose to maim or deliver painful injuries to draw out your foe's suffering.  Whenever you inflict damage, you can choose to inflict 2 fewer points of damage to ease your next attack against that foe.</span>
